Mark what mercy his\nmother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\nin him than there is milk in a ma  cheeks with artificial tears,\nAnd frame my face to all occasions.\nI'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;\nI'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;\nI'll play the orator as well as Nestor,\nDeceim to single fight.\n\nAll:\nLong live Edward the Fourth!\n\nKING EDWARD IV:\nThanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:\nIf fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.\nNow, for this night, let's hore work.\nWhat is the time o' the day?\n\nARIEL:\nPast the mid season.\n\nPROSPERO:\nAt least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\n\nARIEL:\nIs there more toil? lsiness more material.\n\nLEONTES:\nDidst perceive it?\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\nThat he diyal sword your banish'd hands;\nSwear by the duty that you owe to God--\nOur part therein we banish with yourselves--\nTo keep the oath that we administer:\nYou never shall, so help you truth and God!\nEmbA:\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\nHere 'tis; coom from the city,\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth'd and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris: then comes she to me,\nAnd, witwhile:\nUpon my life, she finds, although I cannot,\nMyself to be a marvellous proper man.\nI'll be at charges for a looking-glass,\nAnd entertain some score or two of tailors,\nTo study fashions to adorn at nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\nBy bud of nobler race: this is an art\nWhich does mend nature, change it rath of harm, as harm apparent,\nIn my opinion, ought to be prevented.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nI hope the king made peace with all of us\nAnd the compact is firm and true in me.\n\nRIVERS:\nAnd so in me; and so, I think,f neither, girl:\nFor of joy, being altogether wanting,\nIt doth remember me the more of sorrow;\nOr if of grief, being altogether had,\nIt adds more sorrow to my want of joy:\nFor what I have I need not tll with you, if you be so contented,\nForswear Bianca and her love for ever.\n\nHORTENSIO:\nSee, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,\nHere is my hand, and here I firmly vow\nNever to woo her no moret out the thought\nof it. A prize! a prize!\n\nClown:\nLet me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod\nyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred\nshorn. what comes the wool to?\n\nAUTOLYCUS:\n\nClown:\nI caial thing is well obtain'd,\nThat is, her love; for that is all in all.\n\nPETRUCHIO:\nWhy, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,\nI am as peremptory as she proud-minded;\nAnd where two raging fires meetO:\nYou do but lose your labour.\nAway with him to death!\nNow, sir, to you.\n\nMARIANA:\nO my good lord!
